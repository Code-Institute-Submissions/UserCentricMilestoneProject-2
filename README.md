# Kiwi Bus Tours
---
## Code Institute -  User-Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project One
---
[Live Project can be viewed here.](https://rhyspollarddevelopment.github.io/UserCentricMilestoneProject/index.html)

The goal of this project was the development of a full responsive, static frontend website as a demonstration of application of skills gained from the first three modules of 
the Full Stack Developer Programme. The project focuses on a a HTML, CSS and optional Bootstrap derived website which is functional across multiple devices.

My Milestone project was the development of Kiwi Bus Tours travel agency. This is a mobile-first, responsive travel company set in New Zealand. The company is primarily a take on
bus tours for smaller, more intimate groups which can be easily shared with others and encourages communication with the business.

## User Experience (UX)
---
Kiwi Bus Tours' design was intended for potential customers who would like to travel but are not as interested in large scales tour groups and would like to travel further than 
smaller bus tours would typically travel. The goal would be a website more personable than a companies such as [Kiwi Experience](https://www.kiwiexperience.com/) but offer more than 
smaller buisness such as [Mini Bus Tours](https://www.minibustours.co.nz/).

The project tailors itself to smaller, more personable groups who are not necessarily interested in massive days out or bungee jumping. Ideally this means family groups, middle aged to
older people and those generally less comfortable doing these trips.

### User Stories:
1. As a first time visitor, I want to arrive on a welcoming but informative home page so I know that this site offers what I need.
2. As a first time visitor, I want to see options for tours which are inviting and are easily found.
3. As a returning or new visitor, I want to be able to contact the company easily and if I want to ask for more information or book a tour and know the procedure for contacting me back.
4. As a returning or new visitor, I want to have easy navigation to any part of the site's content without having to go backwards.
5. As an potential customer, I want to be able to find a summary of any tour with key information quickly so I can decide whether this is relevant.
6. As a first time or returning visitor, I want to be able to view this on mobile or tablet as I do not have a laptop.
7. As a first time or returning visitor, I want to be able to easily download or share a copy of this tour with famiy members/friends or with myself for later.
8. As a first time or returning visitor, I want there to be pictures or examples of the tour locations so I can see whether this would appeal to me.
9. As a first time or returning visitor, I want a contact form which is simple and does not require too much information so I don't need to spend long filling in details.
10. As a first time or returning visitor, I would like a way to see the business social media and look for extra information.

The main business goal for this project is to encourage or entice visitors to contact them regarding tour bookings.

### Wireframes
All wireframes were constructed using Balsamiq as it seemed intuitive and easy to learn. Wireframing was of great use though the website did undergo a revision mid-development as poor
architecture and structure of the HTML made it easier to rebuild with better understanding than try and fix with unknown errors. For example, images became carousels as I had realised how
to use them and were often almalgamated together. Similarly, the contact section became a contact page of its own as it did not seem to fit the overall flow of the index page.

Index Page:
* [Laptop Wireframe](../assets/wireframes/indexpagelaptop)
* [Tablet Wireframe](../assets/wireframes/indexpagetablet)
* [Phone Wireframe](../assets/wireframes/indexpagephone)

Tours Pages
* [Laptop Wireframe](../assets/wireframes/tourpagelaptop)
* [Tablet Wireframe](../assets/wireframes/tourpagetablet)
* [Phone Wireframe](../assets/wireframes/tourpagephone)

### Surface Design
* #### Colour scheme:

    For the main colours theme of my website I went for an Americana/Kiwiana theme involving an off-white/cream background with a strong red colour for specific headings and highlights. The 
footer and navbar are a darker blue to mix with the natural greens, blues and greys which are prominent in many of the images on the website and allow the red to stand out for key
points. Colours were chosen using [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) and were extracted from a key image. The colours are supposed to feel warm and inviting and match
the kiwiana theme.

* #### Typography

    My typography uses Oswald and Lato for the headings and main text respectively and were sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). While fonts such as Pacifico or Lobster
would have matched the kiwiana theme better, they were messy and not easily read. Oswald has a strong, bold outline (especially in uppercase) and stands out.
The content is meant to be light and airy along with phrases on the themes of birds to match the kiwi name to be encouaging and welcoming.

* #### Images

    There are many images across this project; most are intended to be large, interesting pieces which are attractive to new visitors and entice them to look more.

## Testing
---
Testing was performed throughout the project’s development through the Chrome DevTools; DevTools allowed any obvious errors or mistakes to be edited or identified in real time. 
Once identified, temporary solutions or fixes could be trialled and then implemented in the IDE. Chrome DevTools presented the chance to trial the website on different size 
screens and even some emulated models on the marker, this was key to developing the phone from a mobile form to a responsive tablet and laptop version also. 

Some errors were found when comparing the laptop, laptop large and 4k emulations as the screen being used was actually larger than anticipated. Therefore, some changes implemented for laptop screens were
being viewed on laptop large screen natively. This caused some elements to not display as anticipated and had to be corrected, often my reducing font sizes.

A key tool for testing was also my code-institute assigned mentor; they code reviewed my project and offered structural and styling advice. Key points found from our meetings 
were incorrect use of the bootstrap container > row > column format, this was corrected where used to be nested accurately. I has also pasted a copyright symbol into my footer
and was told this needed to be an ascii key for it to be displayed correctly, I was directed to the relevant information and inserted the copyright ascii key.

Another key point was the number of colours used throughout the project and keeping them to a set number. Equally all headings and text should have similar stylings and even 
margins to show uniformity across the project. To this end I used the Adobe Color tool to identify colour palettes suitable for my content, I also made a standard margin setting
 across all headings and paragraphs to maintain a suitable flow.

### User Story testing
1. As a first time visitor, I want to arrive on a welcoming but informative home page so I know that this site offers what I need.

    * The main hero image is large and attractive and the bottom of the page leads the user into information about the company.
2. As a first time visitor, I want to see options for tours which are inviting and are easily found.

    * Tour options are clearly labelled and only the second section when scrolling down, also visible on navbar on laptop. 
3. As a returning or new visitor, I want to be able to contact the company easily and if I want to ask for more information or book a tour and know the procedure for
 contacting me back.
 
   * There are multiple contact us buttons across each page, one in navbar, bottom of each page and top of each tour page. Bottom communication panel and contact 
    page both explain that contact will be returned following request/questions.
4. As a returning or new visitor, I want to have easy navigation to any part of the site's content without having to go backwards.
 
    * Navbar and burger icon clearly indicate a form of navigation to all pages.
5. As an potential customer, I want to be able to find a summary of any tour with key information quickly so I can decide whether this is relevant.

    * Tour pages first pieces of information are price, duration and key details so customers are informed quickly without needing to scan.
6. As a first time or returning visitor, I want to be able to view this on mobile or tablet as I do not have a laptop.

    * The project was built for mobile platforms first and is responsive across all device sizes.
7. As a first time or returning visitor, I want to be able to easily download or share a copy of this tour with famiy members/friends or with myself for later.

    * To aid those often offline, or sharing details for later, we have a download button at the top of each page. At the top so returning customers can find it quickly.
8. As a first time or returning visitor, I want there to be pictures or examples of the tour locations so I can see whether this would appeal to me.

    * There are carousels in each tour with a range of travel locations from each trip.
    * Headers also show locations visited on each trip.
9. As a first time or returning visitor, I want a contact form which is simple and does not require too much information so I don't need to spend long filling in details.

    * The form only has 4 personal detail inputs which should be simple.
    * The selection input allows specific selection or information for company and customer.
    * Text input also allow for wide range of information to be offered or requested if customer needs.
10. As a first time or returning visitor, I would like a way to see the business social media and look for extra information.

    * The company has multiple social media links which can be used to show off tours and other news.


Friends and family were asked to read through the site and check for spelling errors, visual problems or broken links without my bias. Key problems found were usually grammatical such as
the mis-spelling of Christchurch, confusing text flow or sentences, non-consistent capitalization of some headers (fixed with the text-capitalize class) or the unused personalised tour page
still in the tour drop-down.

### W3C CSS validator
The CSS code was parsed by the W3C CSS validator with these errors or warnings.
* The only error was that the contact form inputs’ background and border had both been set to transparent. This error was fixed by removing the border entirely and 
then declaring a solid bottom style border only. 
* The validator highlighted a warning with the use of a -webkit-autofill styling and selector used in my contact form. This kit prevents the autocomplete feature of 
browsers from removing the background colour and making text unreadable. While this is considered a warning, I have decided to keep the -webkit in; primarily as reading 
across documentation from other sites had suggested heavily that this is not an error, only a warning and has been found to actually increase compatibility with other browsers.

### HTML validator
All HTML pages were parsed through the W3C HTML validator with these errors and warnings.
* The ascii key I had put in was incorrect as it lacked a ; following the code. This was corrected and tested to ensure it had displayed properly across all pages. 
* The validator also found errors of a small class in the form select option; this was removed as it was incorrect
* Incorrect use of article instead of main around the tour pages and a lack of headings for relevant sections. The article tag was replaced with a main tag and headings were inserted into the required sections.


This project has been run through three different web-tools for initial tests of its responsiveness and prove that the site runs correctly.
1. [AmIResponsive?](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/): A page which runs four instances of the project at difference sizes.
2. [Responsinator](https://www.responsinator.com/): A tool which tests the responsiveness of your page on a range of pseudo-devices.
3. [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/): This tool lets you use your project across all forms of browsers (including versions) and a range of phones and tablets.

I have also tested this project on all the browsers themselves without emulation and (including the above resources) about 30 different devices. On all browsers I have managed to download trip itineraries,
access every page through any other page and have been only able to send a contact form when all fields are filled correctly.
My largest found bug came from internet explorer as it does not support the RGBA alpha channel used for opacity and blend modes on backgrounds. This was fixed by editing the images to 
already have the opacity overlay applied when uploaded, primarily for the inclusions/highlights background and contact page which became unreadable.


### Known Bugs:
*	Autocomplete on contact form leaves a white background on the selected input only: When autocompleting your details, if you used the Surname (for example) input as your focus all the rest will return to normal but surname will stay white. I have not found a fix for this beside deleting one character and retyping it.
*	iPhone 6s also did not load the hero image but all other versions did: This might have been a problem with the browserstack software and time limitations so am unsure. 
*	Email validation: While the input type email does search for an @ symbol, I cannot form proper validation without JavaScript this project does not have access to.
*	Phone Validation: Due to the nature of different phone numbers around the world I also need JavaScript to Validate this.

## Deployment
---
For my projects development, changes were committed to Git and pushed to GitHub. To deploy this website, GitHub Pages was used by the following procedure:

### GitHub Pages
1.	On the Github website, navigate to the relevant repository.
2.	Under the repository name (just above the green buttons for code and Gitpod), click the Settings” button.
3.	Scroll down the new page until you find the “GitHub Pages” heading.
4.	Under the “Source” subheading, used the dropdown to select the master branch to run the page from.
5.	Click the save button to the right.
6.	A new highlighted section will appear with the projects url for you to access.

This project did move to a separate branch named “Style redesign” but was later merged back into the main branch.

### How to clone the repository:

1.	Navigate to the correct repository from the GitHub dashboard.
2.	Above the list of files, click the green “Code” button.
3.	From the dropdown, select the “Clone with HTTPS” by selecting the clipboard icon.
4.	Open Git Bash and change the working directory to the location you would like the clone to be.
5.	Type `git clone`, and past the URL you have copied. (Should be in the format `$ git clone https://github.com/username/repository`.)
6.	Press "Enter" to create your local clone.

### Content
All content is copyright RhysPollardDevelopment. While all locations are based on real locations, all content written or derived from this was 
entirely created by RhysPollardDevelopment.

### Media
All photos and media are copyrighted by RhysPollardDevelopment and sourced from them also.
Tour route maps, kiwi brand icon and signpost image are all created for this project and copyright to RhysPollardDevelopment.

All images considered “smaller” have been reduced to <500kb.

Due to the nature of most images in this project, some images have been left above the 500kb size limit as they take up a minimum of 65-70% of the
 screen and are the entire width of the page. Therefore, I would consider this similar to “full-screen” and compressing further would go against criteria of larger
  images having high enough resolution. No image is above 3MB with all but none 4 hero/background images above 1MB.

## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to my mentor Antonija Simic for her help and advice in developing this project.

While all locations are real and all content written by RhysPollardDevelopment, some inspiration was taken from KiwiExperience for the use of 
Franz Josef as a location in one tour as I have not been to this location.

Libraries for google fonts, bootstrap, jQuery and font-awesome were used throughout my project.

W3C was frequently used for tutorials and examples of how to write or structure code.

Stack Overflow was also frequently referenced for fixes to problems during in-development testing.
